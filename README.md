Exploratory Data Analytics
Given dataset contains data of 1000 machines of a factory, data collected includes some properties of the machines like – 
1. Lifetime of the machine in months
2. when the data was recorded what was the condition of the machine (1= damaged, 0= not damaged)
3. Pressure
4. Moisture
5. Temperature
6. Team – Team A, B or C – the team which was handing the machine
7. Provider – manufacturer or seller of the machine

Perform exploratory analysis on the data and find why machines got damaged. 
1. Use graphical analysis to describe the pattern.
2. Try to answer the following questions – 
a. How lifetime of machines affected to make machines getting damaged.
b. How lifetime v/s team or provider affected the machines to be damaged.
c. Find out some more pattern out of data.
3. Show minimum 6 graphs which shows some strong pattern.
4. Support findings with some real-world logic.
